# üìÉ A GUI tool to batch rename image files using WhatsApp logs or text mappings

### Goal of this project:
- Create a Python Dictionary with key-value pairs mapping original image filenames to their WhatsApp captions (captions are taken from chat logs) or even using a plain text file.
- Support custom regular expressions (RegEx)
- Copy and rename all images into a separate output folder.
- Provide a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter.
- Automate a tedious and repetitive task!

#
### The Contents:
- Launch the program and provide the WhatsApp log file (in `.txt` format), the original images folder and an output folder

<img width="496" height="328" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46a9190a-6fcc-4c4d-883f-6869ace21018" />

- This is the original folder and names of the images

- When the user clicks Submit, the program first copies the image folder to the output directory (to prevent errors or corruption)
- The program matches each original image filename with its corresponding caption from the WhatsApp log using a Python Dictionary.
- The mapping is done using RegEx to find a pattern in all the original image names (think IMG-numbers.jpg)

### Custom Regex Example:
- Here our custom regex will be ‚Äúsummer‚Äù since it is the common name/occurrence across all the images. Clicking the help button explains how the custom regex option works

- Example of a text file where there must be an alternating pattern of original image name followed by a new image name the user wants at the next line. Users don‚Äôt have to worry about white space or gaps between lines as long as the pattern is being followed:

<img width="958" height="176" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff79706a-0f6f-4986-a01c-2ad5d45b536c" />

- Another example of this pattern:
```
original_image_1.jpg
new_name_1.jpg
original_image_2.png
new_name_2.png
```
